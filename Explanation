1. What is DVWA?
DVWA stands for Damn Vulnerable Web Application. It’s like a training ground for learning about security. 
Imagine a website made with lots of holes in it, like a leaky boat, but these holes are on purpose. These "holes" are weaknesses or vulnerabilities that hackers might use to break in. 
DVWA is used by people who want to learn how to find and fix those holes.



2. The Big Picture
You have a computer (your personal computer) that you use to connect to a special setup in the cloud (Microsoft Azure).
This setup in the cloud is split into two main parts: the Red Team Vnet and the ELK Vnet.

3. Red Team Vnet
Think of this as a playground where you can practice hacking safely.
Jump Box Provisioner: This is like a gatekeeper. It’s the first place you go to get inside the playground. You use a special way (SSH) to talk to this gatekeeper.
Web-1 and Web-2: These are two different parts of the playground. Both of them have the DVWA running, which means you can practice finding and fixing those holes (vulnerabilities) we talked about earlier.

4. ELK Vnet
This is another area that works like a detective. It keeps an eye on everything happening in the playground (Red Team Vnet). It uses three tools:
Elasticsearch: It searches through all the activity logs.
Logstash: It collects and organizes all the information.
Kibana: It shows everything in pretty pictures (graphs, charts) so you can easily understand what’s happening.

5. How It All Connects
You connect to the playground (Red Team Vnet) through the gatekeeper (Jump Box).
Inside the playground, you can interact with the Web-1 and Web-2 servers, which have DVWA.
Meanwhile, the detective (ELK Vnet) is watching and keeping track of everything you do, so you can later look at how well you did.

Summary
DVWA is a website you can safely practice hacking on.
Red Team Vnet is where you practice using DVWA.
ELK Vnet is where you analyze what you did in the playground to learn from it.
This setup is all about learning and practicing cybersecurity in a controlled, safe environment.
